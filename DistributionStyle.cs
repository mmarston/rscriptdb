	/// Amazon Redshift distributes the rows of a table to the compute nodes
	/// according the distribution style specified for the table. The
	/// distribution style that you select for tables affects the overall
	/// performance of your database. For more information, see
	/// <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/t_Distributing_data.html">Choosing a data distribution style</a>.

		/// When you set the joining columns of joining tables as distribution keys, the joining rows from
		/// both tables are collocated on the compute nodes. When data is collocated, the optimizer can
		/// perform joins more efficiently. If you specify DISTSTYLE KEY, you must name a DISTKEY column,

		/// This distribution style ensures that all the rows required for any join are available on every
		/// node, but it multiplies storage requirements and increases the load and maintenance times for
		/// the table. ALL distribution can improve execution time when used with certain dimension tables
		/// where KEY distribution is not appropriate, but performance improvements must be weighed
		/// against maintenance costs.
